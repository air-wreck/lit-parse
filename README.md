## A literature reading program based on Thomas C. Foster's book [How to Read Literature Like a Professor](https://www.amazon.com/How-Read-Literature-Like-Professor/dp/8900720163/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_img_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=YK5RVH5VHQ3NS0MT1G2N "How to Read Literature Like a Professor")

The idea is to train a neural network to identify the patterns that crop up all over literature. From acts of communion to showers of rain, literature is full of patterns that can enhance our reading if we see and understand them. If we can do it, why not let a computer try?
